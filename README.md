# Online-Voting-System
Created a Online Voting System in C.

Here you can select admin and citizen just like real machine working.
Admin Username: 56789
Admin password: pakistanzindabad
and in admin mode you can check how many vots does a one party has.

In citizen mode you can give vot to parties by particular NIC and Your Particular area like in pakistan,karachi areas i added malir15,rafeaam.
Nic and areas are for security reasons that in backend these areas and nic are real/registerd or not.
NIC : "123" i added as demo because only those NIC can vote those are officially registered like real-time.
Give Votes in Numbers like 1,2,3 etc if party number is 14 just type 14 and your vot will be added in database.
